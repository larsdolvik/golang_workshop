package challenge

/*

	Hi and welcome to this Go challenge. During this challenges we will utilize 
	the concepts we just got familiar with. 

	The challenge will be to get data for another API, unmarshal it and return on a API URL. 

	What we will need:

	1. A func with an assigned API URL that can be called to initate everything 
	and return data to the user/machine

	2. Func to handle our http-request to: https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/posts/1/comments
	This Url returnes an array of objects.

	3. A create a struct that matches the data structure of the response from 
	the response gotten from the URL above.

	4. Create func that can covert this response to a struct.append
	This func should take a type/interface and the response
	
	
	Tips:
	- Remembmer to define the return types of your functions
	- Remember errohandling and defer
