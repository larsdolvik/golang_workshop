package challenge

/*

	Hi and welcome to this Go challenge. During this challenges we will utilize
	the concepts we just got familiar with.

	The challenge will be to get data for another API, unmarshal it and return on a API URL.

	What we will need:

	1. A func with an assigned API URL that can be called to initate everything
	and return data to the user/machine

	2. Handle our http-request to: https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/posts/1/comments
	This Url returnes an array of objects.

	3. A create a struct that matches the data structure of the response
	gotten from the URL above.

	4. Create func that can convert this response to a struct
	This func should take a type/interface and the response

	5. Test API endpoint

	Congratulations, you just created an Go API!!:)


	Tips:
	- Remembmer to define the return types of your functions
	- Remember errohandling and defer

	Bonus:
		If youe are quickly done or just feel frisky try in incorporate the following
		consepts into your API
		- Go routines
		- Pointers
